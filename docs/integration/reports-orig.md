# Historical Reporting APIs

The following reports are commonly used for workforce management and give you detailed agent interaction records or aggregated statistics across queues and agents.

## Integration Reports

The integration reports are special reports for integration purposes to assist with better workforce management. The integration reports consists of the following reports for agent and queue statistics.

!!! tip "The Reports API calls must be 5 minutes before now!"
    When making an API call for the following reports, you must specify a time period at least 5 minutes before the current time. This means you can not specify a time period in the future, or even the current time. You must specify at least an end time with the end time being 5 minutes before the current time.

!!! tip "Be aware of rate limits"
    The following report APIs are rate limited. This means you can only call the API a certain number of times before having to wait to call the report API again.

    The rate limit is currently set at 2 calls per minute (per node)

    What this means is you may call the report API up to 2 times per node, but your request may be distributed to another node where your API call will succeed. The best way to handle this rate limit is to make an API call and if you receive a rate limit warning `429 Too Many Requests` status code, implement a backoff mechanism (e.g. exponential backoff) to space out retry attempts. You should also log rate limit errors and adjust request strategies accordingly.

* Agent Extended Statistics Report - An extended agent and queue report with call counts and durations
* Agent Segment Metadata Report - A detailed agent interaction report by segment for each call
* Queue Statistics Report - A specific report that lists all the queues in a queue group and the agents within each queue.

### Agent Extended Statistics Report

The report file can be in either CSV or XML format. The table below explains the fields of each interval.

| Field | Description |
|-|-|
| interval | period of time in minutes in 15, 30, 45, or 60 minute lengths. |
| date_from | start date for this interval |
| time (H24:MI) | time in hour:minute format of the current interval |
| agent_id | the agent's unique identifier |
| agent_name | the agent's full name |
| queue | the queue's unique identifier in which the agent is in |
| queue_name | the queue's name in which the agent is in |
| talking_call_dur | total handling time (in seconds) on the call |
| wrap_up_dur | Total wrap-up time or after call work (in seconds), associated with queue calls answered by the agent |
| answ_call_cnt | number of answered calls (only calls through a queue)|
| transfer_out_call_cnt | number of calls answered and then transferred to a queue |

### Agent Segment Metadata Report

Also known as the interaction metadata report, this report is broken down into call legs, or also known as segments. Each segment consists of an interaction between a single agent and client. Each client could have have multiple segments as they are transferred to different agents, but each agent has only a single segment with a client.

#### Request Body

| Field | Description|
|-|-|
| segmentEndTime | Start date and time for the logging interval |
| timeInterval | Interval length in seconds. Maximum allowed length is 3600 (1 hour). Note: if your time interval start or end in the future consecutive requests may return different list of segment. Idempotent results only guaranteed for the completed intervals. Segment recording URL may be added after delay. Allow 1-2min for processing |
| timeZone | Timezone name which should be used for report generation |

**Quick example**: let's say we want to find the report with call start time `2022-10-20T07:47:48`, we'll have `segmentEndTime` < `2022-10-20T07:47:48` < `segmentEndTime + timeInterval` (assuming no time zone offset). So a valid set of values for request body will be:

```json
{
    "segmentEndTime": "2022-10-20T07:40:00",
    "timeInterval": 600,
    "timeZone": "US/Eastern"
}
```

#### Response

| Field | Description |
|-|-|
| interactionId | Unique interaction ID (UII) used to connect different call segments together in transfer/conference scenarios. |
| interactionRecordingLocation | the link for entire call recording in mono format |
| interactionStartTimeMs | Start time of the interaction. Could be different from segment start time if customer was engaged with the IVR, waited in queue, etc before agent joined the conversation. Milliseconds precision |Add commentMore actions
| interactionDurationMs | The total duration of the interaction. Milliseconds precision |
| interactionCallingAddress | The ANI of the interaction. The phone number of the person making the call (this could be the agent or the customer) |
| interactionCalledAddress | The DNIS of the interaction. The phone number of the person who is receiving the call (this could be the agent or the customer) |
| interactionDirection | the direction of the call whether `INBOUND` or `OUTBOUND` |
| segmentID | Unique segment sequence ID within the interaction that typically begins at `2` |
| segmentAgentId | the agent identifier (RingCentral user id) of the agent for this call leg |
| segmentAgentGroupId | the agent group identifier of the agent group this agent belongs to, for this call leg |Add commentMore actions
| segmentContactStartTimeMs | Time agent joined the conversation. Milliseconds precision |
| segmentContactEndTimeMs | Time agent left the conversation. Milliseconds precision |
| segmentDuration | Segment duration (available even when segmentContactEndTime is not provided) seconds |
| segmentRecordingURL | the call recording for this call leg (note, there could be many legs to a single call if the call is transferred) |
| segmentEvents | Ordered list of events. Can be empty if segmentRecordingURL is empty. In other cases array start with the event REC_START. Events don't overlap each other. A child element has `eventTimeMs`(event time with milliseconds precision. Server side), `clientEventTimeMs`(event time with milliseconds precision. Client side) and `eventType`(can be either `REC_START` or `REC_STOP`)|
