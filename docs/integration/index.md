# Integration APIs

The integration APIs enable developers to build custom integrations with the RingCX platform. These integration APIs are unique in that they use the `platform.ringcentral.com` domain for requests. This also means that a developer can find the unique identifier for a user from RingEX (the `extension ID`) and match that to the unique identifier for an agent or admin on RingCX (the `agent ID` or `admin ID`).

The set of RingCX APIs available on platform are part of the following categories:

* [Reporting APIs](reports-orig.md)
* [Administration APIs](admin.md)
* [Routing APIs](agent-avail.md)
