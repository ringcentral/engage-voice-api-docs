# Administrative Audit Log APIs

The Administrative Audit Log APIs provide a forensic trail of configuration changes and sensitive actions performed within the RingCentral CX Voice platform. Unlike standard reporting APIs which aggregate performance metrics, the Audit Log API is a specialized governance tool. It allows organizations to verify compliance, investigate unauthorized changes, and maintain a high degree of accountability across administrative user sessions.

## Governance and Oversight

Audit logs are critical for organizations requiring rigorous change management protocols. This API provides the transparency needed to answer "who changed what and when" regarding the platform's configuration.

### Use Cases for Administrative Auditing
* **Compliance and Security:** Maintain an immutable record of system changes for regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI, HIPAA, or internal security audits).
* **Change Management:** Identify the precise origin of configuration changes that may have impacted contact center operations.
* **Forensic Investigation:** Track administrative user activity, including simulated sessions, to investigate suspicious or erroneous system modifications.

### Historical vs Real Time Audit Scope
The Audit API is designed for the retrieval of historical change records. It is not intended for real-time monitoring or alerting. The system logs administrative events as they occur, making them available for retrieval 5 minutes after the action is finalized. 

### Required App Permissions (Scopes)

Access to the administrative audit trail is governed by **OAuth Scopes** and specific **RingCX Admin Permissions**. These settings ensure that forensic data is only accessible to authorized applications and users.

#### 1. Configure OAuth Scopes

To successfully exchange a JWT for an access token using your client credentials, your application must be configured with the following permission in the [Developer Portal](https://developers.ringcentral.com/my-account.html#/applications):

* **`ReadAccounts`**: Required to validate the account context and complete the authentication flow.

For a detailed walkthrough on exchanging your JWT for an access token, please refer to the [RingCentral Authentication Guide](https://developers.ringcentral.com/engage/voice/guide/authentication/auth-ringcentral).

#### 2. Enable RingCX Admin Access

In addition to app scopes, the user authenticating the app must have the specific **Audit log access** permission enabled within the RingCX Admin portal. Without this, the API will fail to authorize the request.

To enable this:

1. Log in to **RingCX Admin**.
2. Navigate to **Users** > **Administrators**.
3. Select the target user and ensure the **Audit log access** box is checked.

[!WARNING]
If the application has the correct scopes but the user lacks this platform permission, the API will return the following error:
> ```json
> {
>     "errorCode": "access.denied.exception",
>     "generalMessage": "You do not have permission to access this resource",
>     "details": "",
>     "requestUri": "/api/v1/admin/auditLogs/search - PUT",
>     "timestamp": <TIMESTAMP>
> }
> 
> ```

### Be Aware of Rate Limits
Standard platform rate limiting applies to audit requests. The limit is 10 requests per minute. To ensure system stability during large data extractions, implement a robust backoff mechanism. If the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code, utilize an exponential backoff strategy for subsequent retry attempts.


### Important Technical Constraints
When querying the Audit Log Search endpoint, developers must adhere to these strict requirements:

* **Mandatory Account Context:** The `accountId` is a required field in the request body. It constrains the search to a specific sub-account to maintain data isolation.
* **ISO-8601 Offset Requirement:** Time parameters (`startDateTime` and `endDateTime`) must be formatted using ISO-8601 with an explicit UTC offset. The "Z" (Zulu) suffix is unsupported and will result in a request failure.
    * **Accepted Format:** `2025-11-20T00:00:00.000-08:00`
    * **Unsupported Format:** `2025-11-20T00:00:00.000Z`
* **Audit Action Categorization:** Administrative events are classified into three primary action types: `CREATE` (entity creation), `UPDATE` (modification of existing settings), and `DELETE` (removal of system entities).

## Audit Log Discovery
Before searching, you may use the Discovery API to identify which system entities (such as Agents, Gates, or Queues) are eligible for auditing. The `name` values returned here are used to populate the `searchEntities` filter in your search requests.

`GET https://ringcx.ringcentral.com/voice/api/v1/admin/auditLogs/auditable`


### Response Object
Field | Description
--- | ---
fullPath | The internal system path representing the location of the auditable entity.
name | The specific entity type name (e.g., "Agent", "Gate") used for search filtering.

---

## Audit Log Search
The Search API serves as the primary extraction point for audit records. It allows you to reconstruct the history of administrative tasks by filtering for specific timeframes, action types, or individual actors.

`PUT https://ringcx.ringcentral.com/voice/api/v1/admin/auditLogs/search`

### Request Body
| Parameter | Type | Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accountId` | String | **Required** | The unique identifier for the sub-account being audited. |
| `startDateTime` | String | **Required** | The start of the search interval (ISO-8601 `date-time`). |
| `endDateTime` | String | **Required** | The end of the search interval (ISO-8601 `date-time`). |
| `auditActions` | Array | Optional | Filter results by specific actions: `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. |
| `searchEntities` | Array | Optional | An optional array of entity names to narrow the audit scope (e.g., `Agent`, `Campaign`). |
| `createUserId` | String | Optional | Filter for actions performed by a specific administrator's unique ID. |
| `auditedEntityId` | String | Optional | Filter for actions performed on a specific resource (e.g., a specific Agent's ID). |
| `orderBy` | String | Optional | The field name used for record sorting. |
| `ascOrDesc` | String | Optional | The sort direction for the audit trail: `ASCENDING` or `DESCENDING`. |
| `startDateTimeAsUnix` | Integer | Optional | Unix timestamp for the start date (alternative to `startDateTime`). |
| `endDateTimeAsUnix` | Integer | Optional | Unix timestamp for the end date (alternative to `endDateTime`). |

**Example Request:**
```json
{
  "accountId": "12345",
  "auditActions": ["UPDATE", "DELETE"],
  "startDateTime": "2025-11-20T00:00:00.000-08:00",
  "endDateTime": "2025-12-03T23:59:00.228-08:00",
  "ascOrDesc": "DESCENDING"
}
```

### Audit Log Response Details

The Audit Log API tracks administrative changes across the platform. The `actionType` field identifies the nature of the event:

* **CREATE**: A new entity (such as an Agent or Campaign) was added to the system.
* **UPDATE**: An existing entity was modified. These records include an `auditLogResultList` detailing specific field changes.
* **DELETE**: An entity was removed from the system.

The response object provides a chronological trail of administrative actions. Each record in the results array contains the following key attributes:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | String | The unique identifier (UUID) for the specific audit log entry. |
| `auditedClass` | String | The Java class path of the entity type that was modified (e.g., `com.connectfirst...Gate`). |
| `auditedEntityId` | String | The unique internal system identifier for the modified entity. |
| `auditedEntityDescription` | String | A human-readable name for the entity, such as a Gate name or Agent email. |
| `actionType` | String | The specific operation performed: `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. |
| `createTimeAsDateTime` | String | ISO-8601 timestamp of when the administrative event occurred. |
| `accountId` | String | The unique identifier for the sub-account where the action occurred. |
| `authUser` | Object | Contains details about the administrator who performed the action, including `userName` and `sourceId` (IP address). |
| `auditLogResultList` | Array | A collection of specific field modifications (populated for `UPDATE` actions). |
| `affectedEntityJson` | String | A JSON string representation of the entity (usually populated for `CREATE` and `DELETE` actions). |
| `_class` | String | Internal system identifier indicating the underlying document model (e.g., `com.connectfirst.api.model.documents.AuditLog`). |

#### auditLogResultList Object Structure

For `UPDATE` actions, the `auditLogResultList` array details precisely which settings were altered:

* **attributeName**: The internal name of the setting that was changed (e.g., `gatePriority`).
* **originalValue**: The value of the setting before the update.
* **newValue**: The updated value of the setting.
* **classType**: The full Java class path of the entity being modified.
