# About Analytics

Analytics refers to the real-time, historical, and custom reporting portions of the platform in the form of stats and reports. The system collects, shares, and receives customer and call/chat information.

The activity of [Agents](../users/agents/agents) while handling calls in the contact center contributes to the collection of analytics data. Agents record their interactions with leads and customers via configurable dispositions that can be used to track call/chat information and outcomes for reporting purposes.

Throughout these calls and chats, all this information makes its way to the Analytics section of the Admin platform, where it’s stored for future, deeper analysis via historical reporting and/or distributed to various real-time reporting applications throughout the system for instant analysis.

## Core Concepts

Analytics data allows you to examine how your contact center is performing in terms of important stats — such as dropped calls and first-call resolution rates — so you can optimize your operational strategy and meet service-level agreements (SLAs).

You can also use analytics to help identify the high or low points in customer activity, which helps you anticipate surges and plan for them accordingly. You can make adjustments to better manage the schedule of your agents. For example, within Analytics you can view data and adjust how agents are assigned to queues.
